# ⚔️ Offensive Security Labs  

Hands-on offensive security labs and structured attack simulations.

This repository documents practical machine compromises performed across multiple cybersecurity platforms, applying structured attack methodologies and real-world exploitation techniques.

---

## 🎯 Scope  

Machines solved across:

- **DockerLabs**
- **Hack The Box (HTB)**
- **TryHackMe (THM)**

Each lab documents the full attack lifecycle:

- Target reconnaissance  
- Service enumeration  
- Attack surface mapping  
- Vulnerability identification  
- Exploitation  
- Privilege escalation  
- Post-exploitation validation  

The objective is not just to obtain access, but to understand and document the reasoning behind each compromise.

---

## 🧠 Methodology  

Every machine follows a structured offensive workflow:

1. Full port discovery (`-p-`)  
2. Service fingerprinting (`-sC -sV`)  
3. Attack vector prioritization  
4. Vulnerability research (CVE / public PoC / manual exploitation)  
5. Initial access  
6. Privilege escalation  
7. System validation (`whoami`, `id`, etc.)  

Focus areas include:

- Web exploitation  
- Misconfigurations  
- Authentication bypass  
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)  
- Application-layer vulnerabilities
